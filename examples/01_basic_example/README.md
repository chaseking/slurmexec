# 01 Basic example
This basic example walks through a simple countdown running on Slurm.

By default it will execute only on Slurm. If you wish to test it locally, uncomment the `set_slurm_debug()` line in `main.py` and it will run locally.

Use `python main.py -h` to view arguments, which by default are copied from the function declaration.
